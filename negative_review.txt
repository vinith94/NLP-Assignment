- Worst phone. Only camera is good. Totaly worst.i hate lumia.
- Just after purchasing this phone, its screen started opening bing key without even touching the phone. It went for 2-3 months doing this. After that, one different problem came. It started clicking on any option and clicking on keys (lets say i am typing a sms, the phone takes control from you and it starts typing random words and also in high speed, you can not do anything at that time, even if you open the cover screen it clicks on any of the option and do whatever it wants by itself). 
- not really recommended The Nokia Lumia 720 looks great on design, camera but after using for a month starts giving u one problem. The phone starts to freeze a lot. Even while answering the phone u will have to hit the unlock button but this problem wont occur in its first month of use. After that another problem u would notice is the phone will freeze usually on incoming calls where u cant access the answer or ignore button. Not really expected from nokia. This problem persists on lower lumia models too.
- The phone is light and strong at the same time. I have dropped it countless times and it stands strong. However, software-wise Windows phones are bad not to mention vyer slow even with simple applications like Whatsapp. I would not recommend it!
- WhatsApp problem is still continued..m not able to download same on phone.
- 8.1 update(Dev updates)and its hanging so many times.
- i m thinking that MS going do down their market in mobile section. software very poor yet.....plz update as android updatng new features and devloping their operating system/
- bought a nokia lumia in February this year and last week the phone just went off, tried to power it but nothing, had to take it back to the shop where i bought it since the warranty was still valid, its been 3 days and the phone is not ready, i think its a big problem, am really regreting why i bought this phone, most of my friends have one problem or another with this phone
- I have bought Nokia 720 on Jan-2014,The back,home Search buttons are not responding
- no file manager ,no third party app supported ,no system file access which is irritating ,limited Bluetooth use,so many extensions are blocked not even downloadable 
- I use Nokia Lumia 720 after few months touch sensitivity is very low and if call comes to my mobile means am not allow to attend the call because of senstivity problem.
- software and touch pad are not working properly.today it had been strucked from morning 9:30.till now it is not responding.earlier once the same problem had came.then went to nokia care.they said that it will be rectified if press down the power button.now even after doing that it is not even working.please respond to my problem.i am getting so frustrated while this problem occur.
- but the battery drain so fast although enabling battery saver and disabling background tasks except facebook & whats app ,only playing music ,the battery last nearly the day or sometimes half of the day ..what should i do ?..I know that the phone has a great battery from my friends.. Is there something wrong iam doing with the phone ?
- My LCD is broken like a egg in a simple drop. So i cant say it is a solid phone with gorilla glass. It's LCD price is around 8000. Digitizer or touch screen is not changed by nokia all over India and its also not get easily.i using it with a broken LCD. I'm never recommended anyone to by a 16000 Rs. phone which LCD cost is half of its price.
- This phone is a complete wastage of money....first it was giving me all sorts of problems and now i cant even use whatsapp...
- When I call nokia care it says digitizer and LCD is combine and only screen is cant change..whole display change...and its cost 9000 then I go to local store..they also said orignl display cost 9000 but my old broked display is working so they said it replaced with 3000rs so I paid 6000rs but its already very costly my all money is waste.nd display is not great then orignl broked display..m very disappointed.and I also dropped from my pocket..
- m very big fan of nokia n after knowing this 720lumia. i purchase this set last dec. but it was really a very bad experience with nokia though i still have hope from nokia but not from microsoft. from last dec. when i purchase this set (which was my 1st smartphone) i think i had just use it for a month only rest of the time it was with service center. this set deal with n nos. of problems. like volume key hang.. auto screen run.. hang if u use a particular app for a long time.. u can't read ur whatsapp previous chat.. back key works if it wish to work.. 
- really disappointed with this set.. i hate microsoft, microsoft is just spoiling the market of nokia which was already spoiled by nokia due to its restricted app's. 
- Low RAM(512 MB) I am unable to open pdf file in my device.. I have adobe reader,pdf reader,scan to pdf.. Eventhen i am unable to open the pdf document from my mail.. 
- have been using this phone for the past 6 months and my conclusion is don't by any Lumia phones. If you are music lover, don't buy this phone at all. You will be facing the Audio Zack problems and you may not hear the sounds from your device in few instances. If you are music lover, don't buy this phone at all. You will be facing the Audio Zack problems and you may not hear the sounds from your device in few instances.The device behaves abnormally and performs few functions when the device gets wet. You will be irritated by seeing this.
- With in 2 weeks, bottom of the touch is not working completely and I went to Nokia care with previous bills. Now they are saying to change the Entire Glass, which costs me around 9K. I completely irritated with Nokia. 
- Earlier I had respect for nokia for their wonderful phones. Now you lost my respect NOKIA. You better make the Key Pad phones rather than concentrating on Touch phones.
- my nokia lumia 720 is giving me a problem it is always freezing even as am talking to you now it haqs freeze and gone off which am not able to on it.
- disadvantages are volume down button problem, camera button problem and OS limitations.
- Hi it's about exactly one year with my NL720. But now it have some problem in CAMERA while opening. When ever I press camera button/launch camera app after 'loading' the screen goes dark then return to main menu metro UI of WP 8.1 . I make both hard and soft resets of the device but nothing works. Does any one have faced this situation or have any proper guide/solution. Lastly BATTERY hardly lasts for a day before week it lasts for almost 2 full days I closed all background apps except whatsap.I am a normal user mostly use WhatsApp and sometime check FACEBOOK status.
- I have had Nokias for fifteen years and I am disappointed with it. It turns off by itself, freezes, has software problems, half the apps I want are not compatible with Windows.
- I am using Lumia 720 for Last 8 month, really man such a sucking mobile i ever had, most of the famous app are missing in app store. also game like angry bird temple run 2 doesn't work. even nokia connect is also unable to help me out for these issues. cant attache video for sending anyone, cant attache any document file like resume or anything with your gmail. there are many more issues......Suchhhhhh a suckinggggg n never buy mobile....
- its just a crap frds..dont every buy it .i buy it in april 2013 from then its starts hanging , white and blue display ........going back while using any application, jamming in beteen , unessarry vibrating behavior it will vibrate for 10 to 15 minuts coutinously , sotime u cannot pick up your call because its screen is jammed ,.........one the most importnt thing .............its volumr button is ful of crap tull continous to paly on full volume after 10 minuts of music play back and even switch it off inbetees............frds i got it repaired for 4 times in a year ...
- Dont buy this phone
- Windows OS is the hopeless OS. do not buy this mobile insted buy any low price andriod but not nokia lumia 720 or any series. there are very less options in apps, music section, settings. also the windows OS apps are very low quality and no variety. you will repent if you buy this mibile. Just to summarise DO NOT BUY NOKIA LUMIA.
- Seriously disappointed with microsoft and nokia regarding cyan update, earlier I got an alert for update nd then when I update I dint find anything like new changes it was just a glance update , I got to know when i check it in my settings. What a waste I was so excited to use a new 8.1 huh...
- Total waste. frequent problem in touch screen, call recording is missing.
- I ought this phone in October '13 and this is a terrible device. Also Nokia after sale service is not what it used to be. The phone often hangs, freezes , running apps just close all of a sudden , BB messenger missing, instagram only Beta version available, does not have many other apps that cheaper android phones have! Its better to buy a 11-12k costing samsung phone instead of this.
- I bought lumia 720 few months ago, after weeks, it froze, another problem is, it doesnt support videos
- I bought this phone in july 2013. in one week volume botton doesnot work. and even 3G connection cannot perform the speed is pathetic.now I use only camera and call receiving puropse. its a waste of money.
- bought this phone in December, 2013, now in july, it can't fully charge no matter how long i try, its mostly below 50% of charging voltage. I do not recommend it.
- pls dont buy lumia 720 having a prblm in touch pad even replacing touch pad also there is a prblm in motherboard.dont buy windows phone yar.
- its most dangerous phone.
- I have had the worst experience with this phone. I have been a nokia user since 12 years but this phone has been a very big let down. 
- Didnt get the full warrenty. I bought this Phone on june 19 2014 so the warrenty of phone should be up to june 19 2015 but i am not getting that its only up to 20 may 2015 ...
- Problematic glass. I have Lumia 720 handset with warranty. My mobile slipped from my pocket and fell down in the office and the screen is broken and got cracks badly. But the display and touch is fine. I called up Nokia service centers (koramangala and Jayanagar) and asked about the replacement of screen. They have denied saying damage does not come under warranty and replacement would costs around Rs7500 to Rs8000. I requested them to change only the screen and no need of display as its working fine. But they are telling its a molded one screen and display doesn't come separately. I bought the mobile in last August for Rs19500. Now the screen is badly broken. Is it worth to spend half of the mobile price to get the new screen. I have been using Nokia mobiles of all ranges since 6 years. I always suggested my near and dear to go for Nokia mobiles as the mobiles durability and performance was too good. But now I am facing trouble with this mobile. Took it to service center many times. disappointed.
- Customer service is a joke. Each time I email customer service. I get a reply which is a standard template that they use. This is obviously my last Nokia product.
- Screen started falling/jumping/cascading on top of each other with continuous vibrations. not able to operate at all when i approached for screen change nokia care. its cost is 5K plus. not worth.. instead i would purchase a new smart phone what is the actual warranty?? why screen is so costly?? not worth
- Not a good mobile. Its opens the apps automatically, zoom in and zoom out, vibrates by itself, touch screen stops responding and believe me, it tests your patience. I re flashed the software, but of no use. Nokia customer care is so hopeless, they unnecessarily loot the customers. To change a digitizer of 1200+ Rs, they will replace the whole touch screen for 8000+ Rs. Please don't buy this mobile, if you want to have a peace of mind.
- no need for service center. something happens. hardware fault or software hang. just drop the phone or hit it hard. will work fine. give it to service center, they will just reset it to factory settings for no reason and give it back.
- Worst product.  guess this product is not in production now. I bought this product in jan2014 and i have taken this phone to nokia care center thrice. it gives big head ache to me as it gets switched of often and doesnt not get switch on. We cannot remove battery as we can do in other phones, i was so frustrated as doesnot switch for more than 10hours. 
- Stopped working after 5 months. Pathetic software. Hangs every time. Whats the use of amazing looks and great interface if the basics are not right.
- Worst phone ever. Do Not buy this phone It will hang instantly Buy other brands such as lg, htc, samsung,lenovo, etc.
- Poor Design of gorilla glass. The So called gorilla glass broke when dropped by my kid. Do you know the price i paid to replace it. It is 55% cost of the phone itself. The design is such that the glass protudes out a bit and a single fall is enough to break it. Good revenue generation skill by nokia but bad for customers.
- When I first saw the display , I liked it , without a second though bought the phone , initially performance was great and the features provided by Nokia , like free music store subscription for 6 months to download free music was excellent.After 4 months the real problem started, phone started behaving weirdly. It automatically opens apps, camera, even some times calls are made automatically. Did a factory reset with no success. My friends recommended me to update the phone but there were no updates avaiable, after 4 months in August it got updated , it worked good for a week and then it started behaving strangely again. I heard the same problem from many of my friends. I recommend not to go for the product .
- Not Satisfied. Since I bought the phone, I have faced many problems. Sometimes the keys work automatically or doesn't switch on or not charging or gets hanged. Never expected the product to be of such quality after the market hype. Nokia was my favorite since I started buying mobiles but now I am thinking to purchase some other company's mobile.
- definitely not worth 18k.. worst experience using this phone... had lot of issues, gorilla glass quality is terrible, screen cracks even after ph falls from a height of 2 feet. Phone is good but only under ideal conditions. durability factor is less. After sale service is not much of help, seems nokia care technicians have either no or very less clue about the defects in phone.....
- An Utter waste of money !I've brought this phone just 4 months back, Infact 2 Nokia 720....one fell from my couch on the floor and the screen cracked....The other one slipped from my Wife's hand and the screen was completely scattered...Fella's Just dont get this Cheap Phone, You will regret coz the Replacement screen costs 7K in Nokia Priority and is not covered under warranty..!!
- Nokia Lumia 720 is completely garbage. Worst Phone in the world. pls do not buy this lumia 720 phone. I am using it for around a year and every time i have to go to service center more then 24 times. they change my phone twice but did not solve the problem. U will always feel problem in microphone and speaker. This phone can't handle more applications. it hangs again and again. Going to sue the company... reviews online are not genuine. they are fake. those who has bought this phone are suffering now. if you dont trut me thn go ahead and buy this phone and enjoy the bullshit-ness of this phone..
- My battery stopped working in a month and they replaced it. And it again dead. I don't know what the problem is with the Lumia 720, there are so many people getting irritated with the device. 
- Poor build quality. Extremely fragile phone. Keep it very far from water.
- Its a stupid phone. The phone hangs always ... i have to fight with it daily ... very poor software made by microsoft and nokia ... very very dissatisfied ... don waste your money in this phone .. go for a android phone instead ..
- Its better to avoid this phone. Repeated Complaints & Non responsive and uncommitted Personnel at Nokia care.
- Bad Choice or Bad Handset. 
- Glass Broken. Pretty Dissatisfied with Nokia Lumia 720, as glass fully cracked when it fell from my hand. Also replacement of glass is exhorbitantly costly at 7000+. Do not buy this phone.
- Never go for windows phone. buying a windows phone means torchering yourself...piece of shit..!!!!!! Never go for windows phone.
- Never expected from NOKIA .Please go for Iphone instead My nokia lumia-720 has already visited service center 2times as of now. Tomorrow will be his 3rd visit. :(
- plzzz for god sake dont buy this idiot box. normal apps hangs all the time. Whenever you have make any urgent call or to use WhatsApp it ll defiantly make you cry as you wont be able to use and so nay things ll be opening on your screen automatically.when it comes to its features guys WhatsApp is completely crap here. It ll show you the error msg again n again. Internet speed is just a myth. 
- nokia 720 worst phone and its service. Hey Guys, It sucks... Don't go for it... If anything wrong with your phone Nokia care centre from Pune is not able to resolve it..... I have used it for 3 months and its touchpad is not able to work.... Care centre says that it is not available in fact need to do production an all... So think twice if u wan go for nokia 720.
- Worst Phone Ever...Do Not Purchase. SO ALL THOSE WHO WANT TO PURCHASE THIS PHONE I STRONGLY SUGGEST DON'T BUY ANY OF NOKIA PHONE,,,,,,IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY.
- A complete waste - Never buy a Windows Phone that too a 512 MB one !The product is absolutely a waste at this price. One should go for Moto G which is way better in performance than this lagging Windows Phone shit. In short - only looks, no performance. Heavily disappointed with Lumia 720 :(
- Absolute disappointment!!!. My experience with just this particular handset, heating issues, device hangs occasionally while launching an application or game, and restarts, CANNOT MERGE CALLS. You must be kidding me..., most issues started within the first month of purchasing the phone, took it to Nokia service center and got the issues fixed and just two days later the screen completely blanked out, i hope you post this one without asking me to edit it as it does not violate any of your MODERATION POLICY
- After reading the good reviews of this phone right here on flipkart, i decided to gift this to my mother on 4th April 2014. Within 3-4 days, the phone started hanging, the audio during calls stared fading in between and finally the fone has shut down. Looks like it is a defective handset... Now the real torture starts to follow up with flipkart to get an exchange or refund. Its been 2 days since my complaint and I havent heard back from them... So well ALL THE BEST TO ME!!!
- Please dont buy it.  bought this phone 6 months ago. The phone is very good lookwise, also the feel is great. But the performance is not good. The next day of buying, it started giving problems. Who say that the phone doesnt hang, it hangs every 3 days. First the headphone jack was not working. Then the screen started to freeze. Later it got restarting on its own. The volume button was not working. And its not working since then. Dont buy this phone. I checked online. Other people are also having the same problems. Mine 18,000 are wasted, dont waste yours
- Bad Quality Product. I am not happy with the product which is delivered to me . It gets hung up many times and its less than a month I purchased this product . 
- Please avoid this Windows phone. Please never ever choose any Windows phone. I bought Lumia 720 basing upon some rougue's review around 6 months ago. As per the technical specifications its hardware is believed to be good. Unfortunately it is the Windows 8.0 OS that made this phone useless/dumb. Believe me it is a great betrayal by Nokia and Microsoft. Window OS is a greatest 'hit' across the globe for desktops and laptops; This mindset of mine bluffed me.
- Apps are not developer friendly... that is the reason none of the Window's apps is good in comparison to its Android equivalent apps. (Simple example: 'CAM Scanner' is hit in Android phone; and UGLY in Window's phone); It is a open challenge and you can take any of the application and compare... Bad product
- One cannot open a word file using its own 'Office' application. Original page format is fully distorted and you can never fit to its original page. Same is the case for all other office applications like excel, power point etc. Ironically, Windows office is the World's best office suite for desktops and laptops. Utter disappointment.
- Not good. Phone switches off all of a sudden. Happens with Micromax too. Battery back up on 3G doesn't last more than 5 hours. Micromax had almost 1 day back up on similar usage. The keyboard is plain stupid & worse than regular phones. By default it comes with English & Hindi. If you disable the Hindi dictionary, the English keyboard doesn't auto-capitalize or offer word suggestions. 
- Not worth - Don't go for any windows phone. There is nothing good about this OS. You will not get any resale value unless going for exchange offer. It's my advice to you, avoid windows phone, I have already used other lumia hand set. It was also a painful experience. This time I thought that Windows 8 might have came with a bang after fixing all those draw backs. But this time too it disappointed me. Actually I was brand loyal to Nokia (not now) that's why I tried it but I must say that Nokia has taken a wrong step. Only camera can not be USP...Nokia can not fool people only by their camera(really best one).
- Since its nokia built in Quality is Awesome... But OS wise...i didn't like it expected more....Cam quality is pretty good...in that range...
- Lost my money. i purchased it for 16,700!!, and within 4-5 months it started behaving abruptly. It automatically vibrates, Apps gets closed and Bing search gets open. It happens again and again and I cant use my mobile at all. searched on the net and many users got the same problem like that, please please don't waste your hard earned money on this. Better go for Samsung which atleast gives you a phone to use!!
- i made a mistake when i bought this Lumia720. after a month my Lumia got camera issue, screen flickers when i launch camera, went to Nokia care they could not fix the problem even after 8 months, neither they are replacing the device nor they are able to give permanent fix to this issue, out of 8 months almost 3 months my phone is kept at Nokia care, how pathetic service they have. after running 7-8 times i have decided to to go to consumer forum. guys , don't buy this pathetic product..
- Buggy phone. Had to get it replaced twice before i got a working phone. And then it had a million bugs. Cant explain everything here. Just not satisfied with windows. Android users never shift to windows, you will suffer. For instance, there is no file browser, u cant access ur files.
- Worst Mobile. Cons- very Bad OS , crashes frequently, Bad Built in speaker.,Headphone quality very bad.,Audio Video Softwares Very bad.,  frequently disconnects wireless., Costly,No Software update till now...
-  ordered a Black color one , but i got a red color set .I am not at all satisfied . Why its happend ? Is this the way to deliver the product ?
- Doubt if this is a smartphone for today's world! I sold my Windows mobile just 25 days after purchase. Photos upload in facebook is restricted to just 5 photos. I remember uploading 18 photos via my android mobile running 2.3 Gingerbread.
- Mobile becomes "extremely hot" when i browse internet or fb for just 10 mins where network signal is weak. Other mobiles work cool in the same area. No copy paste option in browser or in address bar. I shud use Nokia Maps to see route by roadway and need to switch to another app for seeing route by rail. Please do not buy this.
- Totally disappointed. NO BASIC CALL QUALITY in the mobile. Hard to listen and receiver unable to hear our words at all.... Im highly disappointed and changed to MICRO SIM etc etc advices in Internet but doesnt work anything.
- Do Not purchase windows phone.  strongly suggest that windows phone should not put in smart phone category. I recently bought lumia 720 and it has too many limitation then its better to buy a 10k range android phone. 
- we can not move the pics and files ,can not rename the files, no search option in the test msg, photos, and files.,worst thing I faced just now, when I had to send a mail attaching a PDF file , surprised to know that there is no way to attach PDF files.how a phone can be called smart without the basic feature.  there may be more basic limitation, since I am exploring it still... :( :( :(
- Disappointed with lot of bugs. After getting the lumia 720 i was very much excited to use. Initial days its performance was good and the transfer data from older to new mobile was very quick and a useful feature. I am very much disappointed with a bug. It automatically starts vibrating and keeps on opening the bing page and we will not be able to even do a touch to the screen. This happens when an app is open or when we are on call, the call would have got over but still we will not be able to click end call we cant even switch off since touch will not work. We need to wait for the mobile to stop vibratin g before we could do some thing.
- Nokia Lumia 720. Not a good product. I bought the phone in november 2013 and it went dead just after 15 days. After pleading with nokia for over a month got a replacement. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE or any nokia phone. This phone's parts are not available. They are not manufacturing it any more. Only old stock is being cleared.
- DEAD IN 3 WEEKS. The delivery was good, but apparently some grave issue with the product. My Nokia Lumia 720 conked off and died in less than 3 weeks. And now it won't start even with the Hard Reset feature. :(
- very bad. do not buy this item.. its very cheap... Im facing many problems now... even it switched off today morning and not even turning on... i have brought this through flipkart on dec 4th 2013... and today it has broke down...
- Unfriendly Nokia Lumia window phone. My primary application is telephone and SMS. This phone is not suitable for me, since it is not user friendly. For a bulk SMS, I `m forced to enter each adress individualy, which is the most tiresome part.
-  brought this phone for my wife with much expectation that it will be better than Android. However I was wrong. The phone stopped working after a month. It would not switch ON. I took it to Nokia Care and they were more interested in selling me an extended warranty than servicing my phone. They did repair my phone for what they said to be a software problem. Now again after 4 days, the phone has stopped working. I tried resetting the phone with all options given in Nokia Manual and website, but nothing works. NOKIA logo appeared on screen few times but that too has now disappeared. Honest advice. Avoid this phone.
- Nokia cheated customers. I bought this phone just a month before for 17400 INR, in just 3 days the value of this phone got decreased to 15400. From day 1, this phone is hanging for every operation i do. Sometimes i am not able to answer incoming calls also due to this problem. The primary need of any phone should satisfy this but this product doesn't meet it.  Finally this doesn't have and break proof, it just fell down from my hands at max half of the meter and the display is completely gone(Please Note: not only my phone, this happened with couple of my colleagues too). Please don't buy this phone
- sim error problem with lumia 720 & also poor signal strength than android devices (NOT wise to choose this model).
- I had to get my 1st piece of Lumia 720 replaced due to a rebooting problem. However, the 2nd piece also started giving the same problem within a few days. Hence, returned it back.
- I have purchased this phone 2 months ago. Excellent phone. but yesterday i touched it accidentally to my desk corner and the touch screen broken. now nokia care is charging rs 8000 for same. Bull Shitt... It is so delicate and replacement is not cost effective. they are replacing LCD + Touch screen both. although lcd working absolutely fine. Nokia think twice before looting people in the name of repair. similar case my friend has HTC and he got it replaced by 3000 rs only. NOKIA you will not survive using these tactics. I am so Sad that even it didn't fall and it broken. And its physical assault to phone. NEVER PURCHASE or PURCHASE with Insurance.
- First of all, let me confess that I am a huge fan of the Windows 8 OS. And I continue to be. There were many in number who asked me not to buy this phone as none of them heard good reviews about this phone. But I was stubborn and adamant whenever they tried to convince me that Windows phones suck.  Trust me, the very second day of my usage, the phone re-boots itself. And ever since last 5 months, the phone re-boots ATLEAST ONCE A DAY! It is not even able to manage simple applications like WhatsApp. I am not an App-freak and hence my phone has least applications. Yet, the phone gets hung once in two days or so. Looks like Android is the way ahead for people who are looking out for phones within the similar budget.
- SO MANY BAD THINGS OF THIS MOBILE...1.SD CARD FILES CANOT BE SEEN IN FILE EXPLORE EXCEPT IT IS STORED WITH SOME 'Y' EXTENSION ..2.MOST OF VIDEO FORMATS DON'T PLAY, THEY ASK FOR CODEC DOWNLOAD,2.RINGING AND VIBRATION DO NOT TAKE PLACE SIMOULTANEOUSLY SO WHILE RIDING BIKE OR IN NOISY WORKPLACE U CAN'T EVEN MAKE OUT THE CALL.4.DOWNLOADED FILES CANNOT BE TRANSFERED. RATHER WE DON'T GET TO KNOW THE LOCATION WHERE THE DOWNLOADED FILE IS STORED,5.GOGLE MAPS AREN,T WORKING LIKE EXPECTED, NOT GOING IN DETAILS AS IT TOATLY SUCKS.IF COMPARED TO ANDROID PHONES APPS ARE VERY LIMITED.
- Android will be a wise selection when compared to windows anytime. I bought a Lumia 710 a total waste of my hard earned money and I visited the nokia service center atleast 20 times in first 3 months, I am not exagerating .
- Now about Nokia Lumia 720 - as someone said, past performance doesn't guarantee the future performance.  Same has happened. Within first few couple of days I started facing voice fading issue. Connected with Nokia Care and Customer Care. They suggested to change the SIM, then suggested that network in the area is not appropriate. Tried various solutions provided and finally frustrated me gave it to Nokia Care. They did something and gave it back to me in 2 hours time.  Unfortunately, problem remains. Seems like I wasted my money on it.
- I bought this phone a month back. Initially it was so good. I really love live tiles. Later on the problem started. After one month of usage. I have a very bad experience... It freezes during incoming calls, we cannot attend at all.I cannot make calls during emergency. Seriously don't buy this phone. You cannot make calls also.
- not delivering at right time. worst service . poor delivery n poor response. so i have cancelled d order.
- The design of this phone is thinner & rounded on the edge, which makes it difficult to pull out from pocket or pouch. If you are willing to take the risk go ahead and buy lumia 720. I am not going to recommend this phone to anybody.
- Unavailabilty of affordable spares - Bad. All said and done the mic of the phone stopped workign after 3 months and now am forced to use the headphones everytime i get a call. This is irritaing. The service centre said that they dont hav the mic parts as yet and am still waiting..!!! Must be a one-off case but jus thought 'l pen down my experience. 6 months done - i dropped the phone from a height of abt 2 feet and the display glass is shattered..!!! And guess wat.. they are quoting a price of 8k upwards to change the display. Do u think a price of 8k for just the display is justifiable when the new phone costs 15k..?? Changing my rating to 1 star..!!! disappointed..
-  am a recent visitor of Nokia service center after I brought this phone. Every time it goes off or getting some issues. After doing the service it works fine for 2 days, then the same problems getting repeated. Now this is the sixth time I am visiting the service center in one month time period.
- I bought this device online from Flipkart (awesome delivery), but the product is totally nonsense. First of all Windows has a lots of disadvantages as you may read these through different reviews on this and other forums. After one month I am facing continuious display flickering problem visit nokiadiscussion forum for additional details. But this becomes more frustrating when you pay almost 17K and cant get the experience may be offered even mid version phone of MICROMAX. I am totally disappointed and wish could have bought micromax.
- Great phone on paper but not the same in real world...I had purchased two Nokia 720's. They were the perfect Windows Phone's. Good battery life, size, weight and features. However, my opinion soon changed. They phones started giving problems a few months after purchase. Have had touchscreen issues, mic issues, camera issues. Added to this Nokia has just a few service centers which are always crowded and have a very long wait period. I am very disappointed with Nokia and these phones. I thought they had good quality control and support. Surprisingly, both the 720's have been giving issues. I was request you to be a bit careful when selecting these phones.
- not many free windows application, whats app open really slow its bugging, no personalise ring tones for messaging,whats app(personal) and group messages. internet is slow compared to android. well i personally didn't like this phone very much.
- Heating Issue. The heating problems with Lumia 720 is a great concern. While on call the phone gets too heated up. Apart from that everything seems good. Battery is also OK but not as much as the reviews. Lumia 720 doesnt last 2 days with normal usage. 1 Star for heating issues. too difficult to take calls for more than 15 mins.
- Hi,I am using this mobile for the past 15 days,Really worse and worrying :(..Most of the features available in Android is missing in this.Generic features like using headsets to attend a call is also missing.We cannot stop hearing songs in the middle just with a single touch using Headset.(Nokia Sucks).Please don't go for this.WASTE OF MONEY.
- pathetic product and pathetic service from nokia. My life was going easy and happy till i purchased nokia lumia 720. For 1st month everything was going smooth.But suddenly my battery started to drain.On normal uses it gave me a back up of 14-16 hours and on heavy use it gave me a 9-10 hour backup hardly.Even nokia service has been degraded now.I am running for more than 45 days to replace my battery and feel like nokia care has become my next home.Please, if you want to be happy in your life don't buy any product from nokia unless and untill you have really free time for consumer forum.Believe me friends, nokia is not such a company now which it used to be earlier..
-  I bought this phone from a store in the month of May...Its camera quality is awesome...But a week before suddenly the screen went black...Now I had to give the phone to Nokia Store...Please don't go for Lumia...Go for Xperia,Samsung,I-Phones....Windows OS is very cheap...Many apps don't support..True caller don't operate smoothly...Watsapp gives late notifications with poor UI.
- Not a good choice!!!!!!! Go for Android. Firstly I don't like the way Microsoft occupy the entire screen by its apps icons,no meaning to put it on big squares.Secondly I feel that its hanging with heavy 3D games. when you are playing game Sometimes its difficult to receive calls and ended up with miss calls.Network problem is also there even in full signal its showing no signal when other phones on same Sim having proper network.Apart from some extra camera features it doesn't have anything to admire.just waste of money.In first 1 month it will work fine but ater that you will cry believe me for your choice and at end lack of apps is also a big concern.I would suggest don't buy this phone.Go for some other good option available in this range.
- The Nokia Lumia 720 looks great on design, camera but after using for a month starts giving u one problem. The phone starts to freeze a lot. Even while answering the phone u will have to hit the unlock button but this problem wont occur in its first month of use. After that another problem u would notice is the phone will freeze usually on incoming calls where u cant access the answer or ignore button. Not really expected from nokia. This problem persists on lower lumia models too.
- Very good phone in this range. But the phone has lots of hang issue. Don't buy this phone, not recommended.
- Worst Product ever i used..I bought this product around 20 days back..From day 2 it started getting hanged.After 15 days of my purchase phone became dead and not operatable. So, i thought i recieved a faulty product..But even the new phone has the same problem.
- Switch off (Restarts) Suddenly.  It restarts(switch off) automatically when you play games or play videos after >= 20 minutes.Some times it starts HANGing while playing Game after >= 20mins
- Disappointing! Nokia you are over! There are many other issues in Lumia like you can't use full Gmail, Gtalk, can't upload attachments other than photo that one at a time... Just stupid for a smartphone. 
- Not the Nokia that I know. Was a Samsung Galaxy Nexus user earlier after 11 months of use my phone had a charging issue and I had no choice but to buy a phone as the Nexus phone is not supported by regular Samsung Service Centers. It has been over 2 months I have been using this phone. The phone switches off and restarts after a while. Initially I thought that I was the only who had the issue but was surprised when I saw that this was problem for many people and you might be surprised to see how many questions about the same have gone answered on Nokia Forum. The voice quality of outgoing call is pathetic. I had friends and relative complaining most of the times as to how feeble my voice was on the call. Why sell a piece of crap to people? I have been a Nokia user before and reason to switch from Android to Windows was only for the quality of hardware that Nokia used to provide. They should stop selling phones and start selling cameras perhaps thats the only thing they are good at now.
- LCD Cracked. I bought a Nokia 720 about 4 months back from nokia authorised retailer ( product still under warranty ). I accidentally dropped it on the floor ( 3 feet ) and the screen developed a crack internally. The touch was working fine. I promptly showed it to nokia care & they said the damage was not covered under warranty & the digitizer+lcd assembly replacement will cost 9000 Rs (around 50% of the cost of the device).
- Call drop problem. Call drop problem is there. Voice goes to almost zero level for 10 to 15 secs. Using it since june 2013. Call drop problem is still there.
- Dont Purchase this mobile for the reason of offers
- The worst phone ever.... I wonder why i wasted my money on this shit..Sometimes it wont turn on, sometimes it will not turn off , in a month i have to power reset it around 15-20 times, hangs 5-6 times in a day, sometimes it vibrates 15 to 20 seconds automatically, whatsapp very slow, ringtone u need to cut the song to 1 minute or so and only then you can make that thing as your ringtone, volume buttons may work instantly or after 5 mins, and still anyone thinks of buying this shit lumia 720... hatsoff .. go ahead and enter to the worl of hell
- Recently I bought a lumia 720, I had to replace it within 30 days of purchase. Although flipkart made it easy for me by replacing without much ado, as a company Nokia(microsoft) is loosing its credibility as a reliable mobile phone producer. I understand if it is a software issue(you get a chance to fix after delivery), but I see lot of issues with hardware, 4 out of 5 people I know who bought lumia had hardware issue and 3 of them replaced it. Although I like the phone, I won't recommend it.
- I brought this handset 3 months ago. Phone is connected on Wifi for most of time in office, but at home i switch to 2g. I am facing issue of it hangs a lot, and at time restarts it self. I took to Nokia care, but they said everything is fine. I wonder if all things are fine, what's this issue for!!! The camera function is very much unpredectibile, the quality is good, but the app crashes. You cannot move files between phone and sd card- actually there is no file browser to do so. A lot of data is used up in background tasks. A lot uploaded without your notice. In last 3 months,, it has almost uploaded 5 time the actual data on phone, how much is that on pocket bill, you are best judge to that.I do not recommend to buy this phone.
- Not that mature. I hv purchased lumia 720 last saturday and now its in nokia care...The phone has some issue with the mic (microphone) This is the basic feature which is expected to be working by default... When used with headset it worked... but again the headset has no button to receive the calls ... horrible !!! The phone has no pattern lock facility as well... The ringtone voice is also very low.
- BAD LET DOWN. Thought it was a good mobile. Purchased and traveled outside the country. With fifteen days of purchase , it blacked out and hung. The local Nokia Care were as usual, of no use and vague on their replies. Shame to Nokia for putting people into trouble.
- big crap. single sim , not alteast 5 inches, gets hanged again and again, windows is very very slow and many more problems.
- to be honest dont buy lumia 720 i bought this phone this month not even 1 week it started hanging freq and switching off by itself and switching on again after few hrs this is the worst part i think 820 is good which has 1 gb ram and whats good thing is u can remove battery in 820
- Smart phone with weak phone feature
- Windows ph 8 OS often hangs. Only way to reboot is pressing the power and the volume down key together, User interface not as intuitive as android, takes some time to get adopted,  Very often network goes off, Often there is a continuous disturbing noise while making a call, this specifically happens when network is low.What good is a phone offering a plethora of features, having the main feature - making calls not working properly ?!! Not expected from Nokia.
- this destroy my faith in nokia..In 1 month of buying it 3 times dead and i don't get any solution..nd my money goes waist..now my cell at coustmer care center for repairing..i request to all of you who want to purchase lumia pls choose any other option...othewise you wisat your money your time...
- I bought this shit 2 months ago, and from a week it has having a problem even in calling. Every time i try to make a call, call is automatically dropped/finished and sometime it doesn't recognizes vodafone sim. I tried doing everything, switching off, factory resetting, Changing network setting, researching on net, but the problem didn't go. Think twice before purchasing it.
- Bad OS in good hardware. No SMS delivery unification. Delivery report comes as a separate sms which only contains the phone number and thereby making the whole point of delivery reports useless. Funny because even the basic handsets of Nokia have this feature. App specific issues.  Whatsapp- doesnot allow stored music or videos to be shared. True Caller- Doesnt give realtime caller information. hence useless. very few games and apps. even angry birds is paid. If these things dont matter only then go for this Phone.
- Don't buy nokia lumia 720 it sucks! Thanks to flipkart for sending me defective piece of shit! Delivery men was such a jerk I spent 200 bucks to reach the office and finally got my parcel. My suggestion-DONT BUY THIS CELLPHONE.Used lumia 720 only for two days and it already began to freak out..nokia music doesn't display store,offline,online options anymore. While using apps it shutdown on its own.
- We all trust the nokia build quality , but its that much worth. If your buying this phone please reconsider other options...
- I have bought Nokia Lumia 720. It has an elegant design. But the windows 8 platform is not at all good. There are so many flaws in the OS. I got my mobile hanged after 2 mins after switching it on first time. I am not able to set it back. Even if it has a removable battery, it is possible to reset by removing the battery. Even it wont have a reset facility. It is not recognizing contacts list file with *.vcf extension in order to copy the contacts from other phones. Even it wont have the facility to delete contacts in bulk. It is not showing the call duration. The microsoft has to develop the os much better way. It has good competition with Android.
- Software bugs are more. Mobile hangs, it works after a soft reset by pressing the power button + volume down button for few secs until mobile vibrates.
- crap OS. If you want to messed up your life then go for windows 8 phone I think people saying it's a great phone either upgrading from basic phone or a hardcore fan of Nokia or most probably NOKIA or Microsoft marketing people as most of Indians are or never experienced high end Android and Iphone.
- 3 trips to nokia care in less than 3 weeks of purchasing. this device is a crap got so many complaints from this it keeps restarting even after getting a software update from the nokia hanged up once the screen turned to one colour and as the battery is not removable had to take it to the service center again its screen expands on its own and d device has to be switched off else u cnt do anything another flaw is that d messages u have even replied on whatsapp keep poping up that is really irritating
- Bought a 720 recently, ran fine for a month, after a month having issues screen sensor and having issues with booting also. Had to vist Nokia Service twice, they are not able to tell me the exact problem but they boot the system and give it.
- I purchased Nokia Lumia on May 28th 2013 (Not from flipkart) and in a month phone started giving issues like getting stuck. After a month it once got shut down and was not getting switched on at all. I had given set to nokia care and they repaired it in 2 days. After a week again problem came in Camera. Lumia 720 camera button and app both were not working. Again I approached nokia care and it took 2 days to repair it. Now after a week again set got switched off and not at all getting switch on. This is one of the worst set I have purchased. 
- I have bought this product for my brother and he could use it for only a day and from the next day we could not use it as its not booting. The first thought came to my mind how genuine are the products. I am a frequent buyer of this site and really disappointed.
- I have a problem with my 2 month old Nokia Lumia 720. The second day itself it started giving me trouble i.e- Unable to Switch on the Phone Nokia 720,i complained to Nokia, i did as they suggested but the problem continues. In Night i switch off the mobile and while switching on it got stuck displaying Nokia Logo on the screen and none of the dedicated key are working. Nokia Care suggest me for reboot the phone, but that is not work for me.
- SAY NO TO NOKIA GO FOR HTC, NEXUS 4 OR SAMSUNG WILL WORTH EVERY PENNI
- Paying 18.5 k bucks, phone doesn't support red eye reduction, then what is use of Carl Zeiss Tessar Lens with 6.7 Megapixel Primary Camera. Really Disappointed with features and some of application like Whats app, facebook and Games and ringtone is sync with music and video player, if video player is kept on mute when calls come it won't rings, this really pathetic ..
- Very unfriendly user interaction software. Windows (in computers) is popular because of its simplicity. But this Nokia-Windows combination is very unfriendly. I am post-graduate + tech professional, fond of tech products. Even for me it is very irritating to use. Moreover, "beware!" it has got micro sim card! I am using it as a normal Rs 1000 catagory phone. BP+hospital visit is assured if you buy this phone. Got irrrrrrrritated with its stupid software and now purchased Samsung-Android combination-a great decision!
- bought it from nokia priority store at south city mall kolkata for Rs18500 but it stopped working after 7days.its display gone ,can't do anything don't know what to do next.complete wastage of money.my friend also bought lumia 520 from same store and got same problem.
- Friends i bought it on 19 June and phone looks pretty good but as soon as i installed fb and whatsapp.It started to hang and sometimes i wasn't able to restart by using 3 keys.Later on another problem came out,After some time the phone gives u alert like a new msg on watesp or someupdate on fb which is not there.What it was doing is showing previous msgs unread and on the top of screen it shows that msg for sometime which is pretty irritating so i sold this phone at a lose of 3000 now looking for another...
- Useless mobile. I'm using windows phone since 2012. Samsung Omnia was superb but unforutunately I migrated to Lumia 720 in April 2013. Believe me it is useless phone. If you want to know the reality, search "Nokia Lumia 720 Problem" on youtube by Shubham Sharma. Nokia care have replaced my mobile after five irritating visit to there store, but same problem exist in this new set. There is no positive results on updating nokia music, which i have done several times.  I want to file complain in consumer court, but don't know how to proceed. If anyone of you in Mumbai is facing same problem and wants to file, please drop a comment on youtube link...............
- Please Do not Buy Nokia Lumia 720 - BEWARE!!!!!! 
-  I have bought this product for my brother and he could use it for only a day and from the next day we could not use it as its not booting. The first thought came to my mind how genuine are the products. I am a frequent buyer of this site and really disappointed.
- Nokia Lumia 720 got stuck since a month. I have a problem with my 2 month old Nokia Lumia 720. The second day itself it started giving me trouble i.e- Unable to Switch on the Phone Nokia 720,i complained to Nokia, i did as they suggested but the problem continues. In Night i switch off the mobile and while switching on it got stuck displaying Nokia Logo on the screen and none of the dedicated key are working. Nokia Care suggest me for reboot the phone, but that is not work for me.
- In first week of use the phone screen had a scratch which was completely surprising as there was no obvious reason for it. The cost of repair of screen in Lumia 720 is also very high around 8000 rs for a phone of cost 18000 rs. Overall i was completely unhappy with this phone due to the scratch that appeared , further the windows 8 interface even if it appears stylish when used in the beginning is not at all user friendly and has many flaws which are probably disguised in the form of style. Overall i strongly recommend not buying this phone due to above reasons. If you really want to go for windows 8 and lumia go for other version 520, 620 , 820 but dont ever go for 720.
- If Any one is planning to bye this phone now, I would ask you to hold your decision. I got this phone delivered Last Wednesday and since then this phone has got hung twice. First, well within 24 hours of use and second now. May be this is cornered case but wanted every Bayer to aware of this. I have already been to Nokia service center last Thursday and looks like one more visit tomorrow and don't know how many more to come.
- Please check your product for backlight bleeding and dark spots on screen. Received my 720 an hour ago and it has dark spots on screen. These are manufacturing defects and you should be able to get the replacement. Though, Nokia should have better quality control in place.
- WORST MOBILE. LOTS OF PROBLEMS. SOFTWARE PROBLEM. NO BATTERY BACKUP. . NO USEFULL APPS. TOTALLY A DAM MOBILE. WASTE OF MONEY.
- App store is the heavy disadvantage.
- Though this phone is pretty good, i would not suggest it
- Brought this phone last October. Looks pretty good with its sleeky,fluidic design. It has some terrific sensitivity issue.  Feather button (Start, Search, Back) buttons is working intermittently only. Sometimes it wont work. At times, it's perfect. Later 3 months camera failed to launch. Went to Nokia Care as it is under warrantly. As there is deep scratch in the corner of the phone, nokia care told there is physical damage and warranty is void. And the issues 2 & 3 could be becuase of the physical damage. Nearly INR 9000 for the service. I went to 2 service centers. Both of them didn't open & checked what's the real problem. My advice is stay away from lumia series as the service will take You to hell.
- BEAWARE, Pathetic and Flimsy built quality
- I'm really disappointed about this phone; It freezes often and sometimes reboots itself. Sometimes it just turns itself off and it won't respond.  Internet browsing is painfully slow and sometimes, when I'm on a website there are options I can't click on.  Camera quality isn't as good either. Pictures come out washed out, out of focus or with a grainy texture.  Regarding multimedia functionalities, I hate it that I need a third party app to download mp3 files from the internet and videos. I can't share videos via Bluetooth either. I don't think WP is good for productivity. There's no universal search, you can't share PDF files, there isn't a decent text editor either. Connectivity is weak. I keep getting 2 and three bars, but rarely all of them. I've found myself often going back to my Blackberry to do things I can't do here. Overall, I don't think it's a reliable phone.
- I had no problems with the 720 until the 8.1 update. Things won't download, I lost pictures and music. Can the 8.1 update be removed? Sick to death of this phone now.
- this window phone have a problem. it restarts several time on standby mode. i contact Nokia care, they cant solve problem.
- nokia lumia 720 touch pad problem, and automatic screen lock, not working
- Store does not work properly
- worst phone ever.. dont go on the looks.. its better to buy a lower model of lumia.. its so delicate phn.. with simply no good feautures as compared to other brand phones at same price and lower prices as well.. not worth!!
- In Kolkata it cost me 8000 to get it fixed from a service centre. Unlike samsung phones (or even recent Lumia phones) 720's back cover can't be taken off so you can't get it fixed from outside. Don't even try. It hurts to pay 8000 when my friend's samsung phone screen got replaced for 2500. I've heard it's cheaper in Bangalore. I totally regret fixing it now. It was already two years old I should have chucked it and got a new one.
- Me too.. sold my old Nokia Lumia 1.5 yr old sold for 7.5 k ... after denim update the phone was horrible to use .. battery life was a pain very bad .. and laggy to.. and have to play after a restart only even for non HD .. happy to sold
- Worst phone, all apps crashes, cant say a smart phone, it must be said as a feature phone, can use only for basic purposes like calling, messaging. Camera is good but overall device dissapoints alot, it was a huge mistake buying a lumia 720 for 18k.
- Having worst experience of Lumia 720. Its too much slow , & I used only 2Gb Internal memory , 6Gb memory is where I don't know. when I download any apps from store there is a message No free space. Its a Dull phone ever
- what is this in windows phone????????????????? no more application support...i hate this phone......please update in all application support in windows lumia 720
- i have had this awful phone for several months and hate it,it at the moment is frozen on a page i was looking at and been like that for two hours,waiting for battery to run out,before that it keeps hanging and freezing me out.will never get a nokia again bloody crap
- The worst mobile phone ever I came cross. I will never recommend Nokia phones to anybody. Since I purchased it, several times it got hanged. Also service is worst with monopoly. No spares are available.
- Had this phone for 2 years. Constant crashing and freezing, IE crashed several times a day. Youtube videos would only play a few hours after restarting. Hardware issues within a month. OS lacked very basic features at first, updates improved the situation over time. Also had update issues where the update process got stuck with the only solution being waiting for the battery to run out. Constant SIM errors after the latest update.
- I have been using this phone for the past 1.5 years. During the first year the phone worked very well. However, now it has started dozing off quite frequently and that too for long time. Pressing start and volume down keys do not help. When I try to open an SMS of Whatsapp message, phone hangs. The people at Nokia Care are not of much help. They don't give any information on why the phone is behaving erratically. They will just keep the phone for one day and charge Rs. 337. Data security is a concern. My suggestion to new buyers would be to give this phone a miss. There are better alternatives.
- I hate this phone like anything , its hanging and hang till its battery gets over and it get switch off,,.. I am so upset from this fone , I was a loyal customer of nokia , bt now onwards not gonna buy any fone from this company
- its a good phone, but i would prefer the lumia 820 or 830 because of the ram which is 1gb compared to the 512mb
- Exits automatically from apps. Stops completely while using then I have to press all the keys together to come out of it. But the display is awesome can't deny that and same goes for touch and camera. But the is too difficult to use with . I am fed up with it . And also issues with microphone
- I have been using Nokia Lumia 720 but have arrived at this conclusion that it is not net friendly. I have faced lot of problems. It spite of this fact that my service provider is Airtel which is a name to reckon with. If there s any disorder in the setting then it would have never provided INTERNET. As a matter fact it gives but when it will cave in is not known to the owner of this smart phone.
- past one month had some problems with connectivity and all of a sudden the phone became dead!.
- not a good phone.l am using it from 4 months.battery is not good and get hanged during using net.
- The screen is black, not showing anything at all but i can receive calls, text and internet texts. Its not switching off
- very worst mobile i have never faced,it works by its own sometimes
- please dont take nokia lumia 720..other than camera nothing is gud in this phone..iam warning who r planning to take take nokia lumia 720.worst phone ever seen
- I bought lumia 720 last year it worked fine for few months and after that the screen got stuck I can not even see who is calling me and its been 2 days it got stuck on the same screen. worst experience.
- i would suggest to invest the money in any android phone is better then any windows phone. nokia is making people fool on the name of windows smart phones. as per nokia support executive the nokia phones are for good looking and good camera quality (i don't think so). 
- I had made a purchase of Nokia Lumia 720 almost a month back and had a issues with the audio ort and it was hanging and this was replaced with an other Nokia Lumia 720 yesterday i appreciate that. But the worst part was the mobile that was replaced has a major issues like when you open an Application it directly comes to menu and takes to the Bing search Engine and it closes and phone keeps on vibrating for nearly 20-30 seconds.  I doubt whether the Nokia are manufacturing the low quality phones or WS Retail are selling the used phones. I'm really unhappy by this.
- I bought this phone - Nokia 720 - three months ago. The phone is useless. The screen keeps jumping from one app to another without having to touch it. Battery life is not all that great it is said on the product. I will not buy from this brand again or recommend it to anyone else.
- Well no complaints regarding Flipkart Delivery and Aesthetics of the phone. But seriously there are hardware issues with this model or (i dont know may be i was delivered a bad piece?). Within 10 days of usage the ringer of the phone stopped working i couldn't hear any alarms, rings, music through the loud speaker. And phone OS hangs a lot and you have to force restart a lot. Above all to this frustration worst is "Nokia service providers".The kind of service and reasons they give is pathetic. They think we are dumb as donkeys and we will buy any bizzare explanations they sell.  After a long hiatus, I thought Nokia must have come up with really good product, but way to go. Better to use some other reputed models than experimenting by buying this junk.
- Think Before you buy this. The Lumia mobile which I have recently bought through Flipkart is troubling me with lot of issues as listed below: 1. The Mike is not working properly. 2. Whenever I make a call or someone calls me, the screen gets off till the call disconnects, where no such issues with my colleague's phones (same nokia lumia 720).? As a regular customer of flipkart, i am completely disappointed with this product. And I have to point out the services of nokia care. I had yhis mobile for 12 days with me. The Nokia care had this mobile for 23 days for servicing.
- I bought my phone from flipkart and the delivery was quick.but after using it for a couple of days there was some problems with it.like the back or search buttons get clicked on its own and while your using the phone its very annoying because of this.the screens keep changing and othr opened tabs kept opening without me even clicking it.another problem is with the volume.when you decrease or increase the volume it doesn't change.and now after 8 months of usage it suddenly got hung and switched off.and it hasn't switched on since.i gave it to nokia service and they are changing 10k for the repair.the phone otherwise has good features.like the camera is really good and looks wise its amazing.but these problems are a big annoyance.
- After using this phone for 4 months, I was absolutely disappointed. Sold it on olx and bought and iphone 4S. First week with iphone made me realize what all I had been missing all these days while using all the other non-apple smart(ish) phones.
- Very fragile. I loved the phone when I started using it, but I now, after 4 months, regret my 17K investment in this phone :( In this 4 months , the microphone stopped working 4 times. Once it worked after a reboot, twice after hard reset and now, its not working at all.  I got to send it to a Nokia care center, let me see how it is being handled. The gorilla glass, as advertised is not as robust on this phone. Got a couple of scratches in a week after buying. So I had to put a scratch guard. I am seeing similar issues with my friends who have bought this phone. My recommendation is to stay away from this phone for a while..
- I don't know whether it is with the LUMIA phones or problem with the WINDOWS OS. Some of the problems I faced. 1)The phone becomes dead abruptly even with full charging. I have seen the same problem with my friends LUMIA 720 also. 2)The phone screen suddenly gets zoomed in and there is no way to resolve this other than restarting the phone. 3)The stock ear phones are very bad and poor quality Other than these problems the windows interface is good. You are going to love the transition from android. Better to go for LUMIA 920
- I bought a lumia 720 through flipkart two months back. I accidentally dropped my phone and the screen cracked. The customer care charges me Rs7500 to get just the cracked screen changed. Thats close to 50% of the cost of the phone(I bought the phone for Rs15700) Lumia 720 might feel good in hand. But think twice before you purchase. Nokia is not the old nokia anymore. Also your warranty will be void once your screen is cracked. 
- Was a good buy, but not any more. I bought this phone in July 2013. I thought it was a good buy at that time. I liked the overall look & feel of this phone. The Camera and battery life also great. I had gifted it to my father, who used it like a precious gift and handled it with utmost care. We did not have any problems for 10 months. But now I do have some issues with the Nokia 720. After having used this phone for around 21 months, I am forced to come back and edit my flipkart review. Gorilla glass or not, the Lumia 720's front glass cracked. My father is till trying to figure out how it cracked, cause the phone was never dropped. No warranty for the glass and so we had to shell out INR 8K to get the front glass replaced. The other issue is that in hangs frequently. You can't do a soft boot either, as none of the buttons work. All you can do is to wait till the battery is fully drenched, after which it functions fine.  Reducing my rating to 2 stars... Was a good buy, but not any more.
- Windows 8 OS having issues. Please careful before u buy. Im using this phone since 2 months. Im facing a difficult issue. This phone will hang unexpectedly. u cant do anything except hard reset ur device. Untill unless there is an update from windows, it wont be fixed. So.., this phone is clean. but., Windows OS is not upto the mark as expected.
- Its been a week I got this mobile. And its getting hot.!!! Even when am just charging it or listening to music! Dont know if its a software issue or a hardware one. I went to Nokia Priority and told them the issue. They were like this is problem with all Lumia Phones. :o The top half of my cellphone gets heated like anything. I feel uncomfortable while talking on phone.. Though the phone is Stunning, Gorgeous and has amazing apps.. But this is a very basic issue.. Is anyone facing such a problem. :~ I am getting a replacement today. :(
- Cannot attach multiple files in email- was not expecting from windows phone, Cannot mail adobe PDF files any how, Cannot install games or apps on SD card- so 64 GB external memory is for only songs and videos, Cannot even exit a music player, Creating playlist is a mess, Cannot play .mkv. .flv. Files- needs a paid app of VLC palyer for INR 160, Good games are heavely priced It has all bads of Microsoft and no previous goods from Nokia  It is not a business phone- E63 series is far far better than this in any terms Think a 100 times before you buy- not worth the money spent
- I have used the Nokia Lumia 720 for nearly two months now. The performance is Ok. The minus points of this is Windows app store is less no. of apps. Even if there are some apps/ games common to iOS and Android, they are not free. Most of the good apps are paid ones. Also another feature which windows phone lacks is the sound volume controls. There is only one volume control for ring, media, etc. So if you increase/ decrease the ring volume it changes the media volume also.  Another problem which I faced is twice in the last two months the set got completely blank without any display. The battery was charged between 80 - 90% on both times. After 15 - 20 minutes, the phone started again from start. I don't know whether it is a problem only with my set.  Somehow I feel Windows has a long way to go before catching up with Android phones and iOS phone. If there is an exchange offer, I would exchange offer for a high end android/ iphone.
- I bought lumia 720 in june 2013, its been 1 year i am using this using. in the begining i was happy using awesome graphics, good camera quality, good mechanical strength (it has slipped from my hand many a times n still not a scratch on my phone), good battery life. BUT, now i am getting very annoyed by its hanging all the time..!!!! many a times the caller hears the ring, n i have no clue that i had a call (several times i had argument with my friends saying y didnt u call me?? ) its hanging problem is becoming a major one now.. in middle of browsing, sending text and even calling it HANGS..!! moreover it provides very less on board memory space, the graphics eat up lot of memory. if u think of changing your phone in year, and if u are microsoft fan u like this phone.
- Not too happy using windows phone. iOS any day better but for the price, not a bad buy. Would never buy a high end windows phonne though.
- Not Happy With The Earphone. The earphone which i got with my Lumia 720 is pathetic. My friends who purchased from store have recieved an absolutely fantastic one, which is very much different from the one i have. I don't know how this is possible when we are getting a sealed pack ???? I even see performance difference between mine and theirs..
- thoroughly disappointed Used the phone for about 7 months. have started facing issues with the phone switching off and not switching on, it will also not charge when connected to the charger. It always has an issue with hanging which is made worse by the fact that you cant reboot the phone with a battery pull on account of non removable battery, The volume down and power button also do not respond when needed for a reboot, the camera is the best feature but cannot carry the lapses in terms of lack of customization options and severely handicapped app store
- Not what I expected. Really hate to write this. But it not the quality of windows phone that i was expecting to experience. Bluetooth can only share music files and photos and one by one only if you try sending 3 or 4 files in a queue you will be hard time dealing to gt it done.Camera is not upto the mark for 5MP that should be there HTC phone offer much better clarity and you find perfect pixels even after zooming the pic. Heats like its ready to fry fingers while using 3G although its good while using wi-fiNokia support always format the phone, my phone has been formatted for like 3 times within a month.I would advice please go for android windows are still trying to be user friendly.
- Not so good phone !!I  have been using Lumia 720 for the past 6 months and would like to share few things. The look is awesome, light weight, full glossy black and handy too. But Windows 8.0 being the OS has some difficulties:  1. Music/Photos cannot be grouped into single folder, it becomes necessary to cannot to PC and get it done 2. Video shooting doesn’t have a pause button 3. Most of the useful and popular games / apps are paid unlike android.4. Cannot directly select a song and set as ringtone, again possible through PC only. Rest things like sound is good, camera awesome with flash (many apps are available), touch is good, Nokia music subscription is superb. 
- A very fragile device. I wouldn't advise you to go for it, as the phone itself is very fragile eventhough it doesn't appear to be like. Even my Micromax phone have worked OK in rains and about 10-15 times drop. Seems Nokia have lost their build quality these days.
- Buggy. Microsoft chose to ignore such conveniences for users. Everyday things like adding a new contact is a pain and requires 4 screen transitions to finally save one, first confirm number, then type of phone number, then on a diff screen save the name and then finally save the overall contact, painful. If you have to dial a contact from phone book, you have to go inside it, there are no buttons next to it in the main list. Many other such restrictions and lack of flexibility shows the high handedness of Microsoft and Nokia OS engineers who are clearly living in denial vs an iOS or Android.  Other users too pointed out no notification or main common settings bar available, go in settings to change wifi or data, heck! The music space also is a bit of a puzzle, not very smooth to operate.  If this is the thought they gave to their first big-bang OS, imagine @ what speed and difference, updates to the OS would come. Again down with MS & Nokia. Overall I wonder whats the premium price for really, when you get Sony 7 HTC phones now with better build & 1 GB RAM, Nokia lumia 720 plays Temple Run first version with a lag and misses various touches and gestures. Imagine!
- Battery Performance not that much good..Unlike normal Nokia phones Lumina not giving good performance as expected. Battery works as same as all other smart phones...max 24 hours..only..remaining every thing seems good as i observed still now..
- Not a good SMART phone. When I tested the device at the local 'Chroma', what had me hitched to this device was the ultra-smooth touch and a UI that was different from Android. The camera was super fine and so was the speed with which i was shifting between different menus. Little did I know that the device had some basic features missing which makes it an unworthy candidate to be called even a competitor to Android. Buy at your own risk. I have already put an ad on OLX for selling this phone.
- Problematic glass I am really dissappointed by Nokia this time in spite of trusting a lot. I have bought this mobile with great difficulty managing the money every month. Please help me out to solve my problem.
- I have recieved my Nokia Lumia 720 in April and started using it. How ever i felt that some of the features compared taken at Nokia Show room were different say settings. I would say may be my delivered piece is not that good functional wise and defective one. I tried by all means changing the setting and all but something is missing. It doesn't mean that every body will have same experience but happened to me. So would suggest for mobiles better to buy in show rooms where will have warranty and service.
- dont buy this mobile even for 10k. I have purchased this mobile it have very sensitive glass it will break easily when it fall down I have seen this mobile with broken and replace its glass with less than 6k
- Almost 1 year since I bought this.Within first 2 weeks, the phone went into infinite vibration and heated up.After several follow ups,they refused to replace the damaged piece and instead refurbished and returned it.Worked fine for a week or so but the volume down button has stopped working ever since.Nokia never gave me a report on what was wrong despite follow ups.The phone does freeze up once every 2-3 months and starts again only when the battery discharges.Despite all da issues I have managed to hang on for almost a year. Pros: Superb battery life. Cons: Poor service, poor voice quality, difficult to use for more than 12 months.
- Please do not purchase dislay and touch very costly if broken and problem in voic another persone not able to do i had gone many times service center they say no issues
- I order this phone before one year ago from Flipkart.  The features provided by Nokia are totally unbelievable. I granted that their is no such phone in market having such features in 17k. but software, useless & 3 rd class os is installed in this phone Bluetooth abilities are restricted, no file manager, can't share videos, lack of applications, settings are not useful to use this phone up to full extent, problems in volume adjustment. so because of Microsoft this phone is useless
- i have got this phone broken twice in one month, phone is good but display sucks, phone display breaks easily and is of huge price 7K. it can break after falling in less than 60cm.
- I  bought this phone 5 months back, people watchout the phone as issues with turningoff automatically and freezes. I rate the product as 2.
- poor battery. i have been using this phone for last 4 months. overall the phone is good. but the software limitations delimit its capabilities pros: good camera, good sound, best touch experience ever had battery is poor only if u are using internet continuously, which i do. lasts for about 20 hrs. without internet goes for around 48-50 hrs
- I bought this phone about 8 months back, and I'm finding a problem when using this phone with Wifi. The phone freezes when using Wifi, and a user receives calls at that point of time. We have experienced this issue multiple times, and had to hard reboot the phone. Last time I had this issue, I was not even able to hard re-boot. I had to take it to a service center.
- Windows fails to charm ! I was an Android user, who is feeling dry with Dumb windows store with too little apps with little innovation. Camera does not live upto the expectations given...
- I wished Nokia would have used some other Phone OS for Lumia. I love the Lumia Phones, but the Windows Phone OS just doesn't understand what people want. My advice to people who are interested in buying Lumia/Windows OS phones, is to try it first if any of your friends have it or at your local mobile stores & then decide. I would rate it 1 Star , but the xtra one is for the Camera.
- Its not a great worth for this amount. I purchased lumia 720 through flipkart. I received next day itself. I found lot of bugs in the Windows OS. Ex. hang issue, Automatic reboot, some time font size is increased and it will come to normal font size. My suggestion is go for good android phones.
- bad performance. Im now using lumia 720 which I bought from you. im facing some problem with its performance, I dont know that im facing this just because bought from flipkart on it is entire limia's problem.......
- Very bad phone screen sucks every time. Went to gallery they repaired the phone after 20 days. Again screen got not responsable.
- Lumia 720 comes with some good features and some bad. and a worst issue. I am using this mobile from last 5 months. I just wanted to check my experience before writing review. So now i am giving my review. Camera quality is good in day light under auto mode. under dark with flash settings has to be done manually to get better picture. Over all Good camera quality. Display is also nice. Clarity is simply super. Nokia music average. If u download songs from nokia music then you cannot vary volume while song is playing. Don't know why. heard this issue from my friends also. While 3G or WIFI is ON. mobile get reset by itself.  Worst part i am facing is. Touch screen and buttons get freeze for few seconds and you can't call, receive call. can't do anything. It happen frequently I found this issue raised my many people in nokia blog. Basic part itself is touch. If it won't work then what is the use of this mobile.
- Good phone but fragile and fraud service centers.2 months after buying this phone the touch buttons started misbehaving. The back camera cover also fell off. This was just not expected from Nokia which usually have delivered rock solid products. When i took this to the service center I was told that since the back glass for the camera is not there the warranty is void and my phone will not be covered. I had to spend 8000 to repair my touch points! Lesson learned! Never again!
- Very Bad quality ......suggested never buy
- Not up to the mark!. 1. Even though the software/hardware look cool, in reality it is not good. The phone has the tendency to go into coma once in a while. What do you do? Press Volume Down + Power Button and hold for 15-30 seconds till the phone reboots. After paying 16K+ for the phone, I feel cheated to do this 1-2 times every fortnight.  2. Speakers are flaky and little bit of humidity (moisture), they go boink! Never seen this happen to other phones that I have used. What happened to the rough-n-tough image?  I hope these 2 points help you take a better decision!'
- Head set design and sound quality is poor. Video chat experience is bad because of a default automatic screen server set up in the phone.  Setting up ring tones are a difficult experience. Phone is not worth for the price.
- Hangs frequently (and for hours). I have raised a request to return within 2 days. I loved the phone UI and display, and would have been best phone (better than iphone and android) if there is no hanging issue. Anyways, a bad is a bad.
- The service from Flipkart is good.But th phone started giving problems after working well for a week.
- Loved when I bought it. But gradually, showing problems. There are many. Biggest one is of late, I have been getting serious network connectivity issues. very frequently, it shows No Service and miss many of my calls. potential loss of business for me there. I tried using different sim cards on my phone and it shows same problems. I used my own sim card with my wifes LG Optimus and it works fine in that, so its not a network or sim card problem. Apparently, Nokia care center does not seem to be finding any problems with that ( sad). I thought may be this problem is only with my phone, but when i checked online, I got a few cases who had the same problem. So, its an issue with this phone. Because of connectivity problem, even battery drains a little faster. A BIG NEGATIVE ON NOKIA's part! Few things, which are small but important - it does not have options of 'Cut', 'Select All' option for text.  In its much famous Office app, the editing functionality of excel and word is very very limited compared to Online Office and desktop Office. This one is a NEGATIVE on Windows part. You have to install some third party app or go through tedious maneuvers to enable or disable WiFi, Location services, Data, etc. Even third party apps are not as quick as the functionality available with android phones or now on iOS.  Crashes when using some heavy apps (like good graphic games), but that is not a serious problem for me.
- i have buy this phone in 2 may and from then i have gone two times for service centre some times it doesnot start , and even when i checked out in service centre now a anothr kind of pb. now when i go to make a call or recieve a call the screen go blank.
- Not as flexible as Android phones. No File Manager. A serious drawback. If you download a file, and the file is not an image or MS office, then you have no idea where the file is stored Can't attach files other than images and MS office files in email (you need to buy a paid apps for attaching PDF files) Cannot use its own email interface for forwarding files other than image and MS office file. However you can do it by installing UC browser  You click a photo and want to share it through Facebook. You cannot directly. You have to separately open Facebook Cannot store a Facebook photo in your device. (However there is an app "Smart FB" which helps you to do the same. It heatens up even after 30 mins of talking (if not using loudspeakers)
- completely boring if earlier user of android phones. Lumia 720 is simply a windows phone...you would either become bore if earlier you had android phone and much addicted to android.. not so much apps and user freindly as android phones are. I bought this mobile 3 days before and with 2 days i have used almost all the apps of nokia and free apps but not anyone is entertaining. Pros and cons: 1. nokia music store is really helpfull for finding any song and easily download..you can even easily find songs that are not easily found in google. 2. Camera apps in lumia 720 are good. certain apps of camera are good. 3. photos are good but it makes the eye red and there is no option to edit these red eyes..so overall makes the ugly look of photos. 4. Battery backup is good. 5. Touch and sound quality nice. 6. Display quality is really good. 7. internet explorer is very good can play all type of online videos. 8. Games are running not so good. 9.Can't transfer files through bluetooth 10. Can't download videos even of the youtube downloader.
- a sucking phone. The Windows 8 is not a success. hanging problem, auto restart, screen stuck etc are a major predominant problem across the windows phone. Otherwise why there is no one is interested in making apps for windows(even ministry of external affairs released app for andriod/i phone/blackberry but not for windows phone 8), because it is a failure and neglected from microsoft. There is some definitive connection between faulty pieces and online retail stores (may be a hidden agreement between nokia and online retailers).
- Worst Phone Ever from Nokia. So, at the conclusion I would like to say that this phone has a lot of disadvantages rather than its advantages. For all those who are planning to buy this phone.....Please for GOD sake "Don't buy". You will find a lots and lots of better phones in the market than this one.
- prefer ANDROID mobile if you are a gamer. 1.if ur a temple run fan donot buy this phone 2.its camera is quite good 3.it supports hd videos and plays without any lag 4.for this phone only limited number of good game are available like assassins creed, asphalt 7 heat,final fantasy bcz of its low ram 512mb 5.the worst thing is, for playing angry birds we have to buy it, but in android all parts of angry birds are free 6.i havent noticed any speed difference between android and windows,and windows lags sometimes and shutdowns suddenly and restarts moreover better not to buy this phone if u wanna buy only nokia then go for lumia 820 (or) 920 its ram is 1gb so some more games will be available or else if ur a big fan of games better go for sony xperia l (or) sony xperia sp ,these both phones plays all games from the store
- One of the worst phone not worth. This is one of worst phone .Always a hanging problem window 8 is not matured enough to handle small tasks also. Some time volume low and up keys does not work again i need to restart the phone.
- I am experiencing severe problem to activate my Skype, whatsApp etc. I tried all ways but miserably failed.
- too much lagging and app switching is still a dream.. sometimes apps crashes when doing multi tasking after showing resuming... wasted 18k
- Me being a user of Lumia 720 have come across various problems like non-functioning of the lower volume key, motherboard not functioning and frequent problems with the display. 720 is a faulty one so please don't go for it. These problems are witnessed by one of my friend too who is a user of Lumia 720 itself.
- Don't buy this phone after using 6months you will be getting below problems like:  1) Down volume key won't work to do soft reset  2) Mother board problems will occur (it's cost 7000rs) 3) phone will heats up you don't known when it will blast. 4) No Battery backup daily you have charge mobile.
- I have purchased lumia 720 by believing in brand, quality and servicing. Till today its exactly 9 months old but after 8.1 update i have faced problems with software stuck every time, speaker doesn't works after turning of Bluetooth and touch problem faced second time(every time i faced this issue nokia care takes 40 days to repair my and return my device). This shows the quality of goods the company supplies.
- This is one of the worst phone I have ever seen even d so called local mobiles performing far better than this . The phone hangs a lot I can't even restart it I have to wait for long nd long hours to letit start, no proper apps nothing is good. The day I purchased this m nt at all satisfied nd i keep on regreting myself for wasting 18 thousand rs
- Worst phone. I have been using this from jun 2013. I didn't find much problms in the first year. Problems started Exactly after 1 year. Everyday I regret my self for a wrong decision I did when I bought this phone. Apps are not gud, phone hangs and I couldn't use it until the phone is restarted, phone has to switch when it is running out of battery, no one can restart the phone.  By the way I use my phone very gently. Not only me, except microsoft lovers and hardcore nokia fans everyone I know is feeling bad for their wrong decision on choosing this worst mobile.
- i purchased last year i am not satisfied with battery backup, and sound other than remainning features ok.
- nokia lumia cheating the customers .dont buy nokia lumia.its not user friendly.my lumia 720 black is now complainted. then i went to nokia care they reply me ur handset having board problem. they cant repair that prblm. how believe the prdct of nokia and their authorised sdervice centre. now i lost 19000 rs ....
